## Classic Game, Powerful Framework under the Hood

This is a classic pong game: there is two paddles for two players, each player shold catch ball so as not to loose.

And there is a powerful game framework under the hood as my architectural experiment:
- MonoGame as basic game framework;
- Arch ECS for tools, game entities and states management;
- Myra UI for menus and UI/UX;
- Aether Physics as physics engine.
